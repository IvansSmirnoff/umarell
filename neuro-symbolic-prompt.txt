I am working on a research project for a Facility Management dashboard.
Current Stack:
- Database: Neo4j (storing IFC data as a Labelled Property Graph) and InfluxDB (time-series).
- Logic: A local LLM that translates natural language into Cypher and Flux queries via RAG.
- Problem: Reviewers questioned the novelty and asked to justify using Neo4j (LPG) instead of Semantic Web standards (RDF/OWL).

I want to upgrade the architecture to a 'Neuro-Symbolic Hybrid' approach.
Please generate the following three items:

1. Architectural Logic (Python Pseudo-code):
Create a Python class structure for an 'OntologyGuidedRouter'.
- It should use a lightweight ontology (like Brick Schema concepts) to validate user intent *before* generating Cypher queries.
- Workflow: User Query -> Extract Entities -> Validate relationship feasibility against the Ontology (e.g., 'Do Windows have Wattage?') -> If Valid, Generate Cypher for Neo4j.
- This hybridizes the strict logic of RDF with the performance of Neo4j.

2. The Defense Argument (for the paper):
Write a technical paragraph justifying this architecture. Explain that while RDF/OWL provides semantic rigor, LPG (Neo4j) provides superior traversal performance for large BIM models. By layering an 'Ontology Validator' *on top* of the LPG, we achieve the reliability of the Semantic Web with the speed of Graph Databases.

3. Updated System Diagram Description:
Describe how the arrow flow changes in the system architecture diagram. Specifically, where does the 'Semantic Validator' sit in the RAG pipeline?
